# Neulabs fullstack assignment

## Setup

This project should work with all recent node versions, if you want to be sure you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and run `nvm use` to get the version we used to prepare the assignment. (or just install node v16.9.1 if you prefer)

Then run:

```
yarn
```

And you are ready!

## Run the project

Run the bff (backend for frontend) - apollo server:

```
yarn workspace @neulabs/bff dev
```

Then run the website (nextjs):

```
yarn workspace @neulabs/website dev
```

Don't worry about builds, serve or other commands, just make your work with these two commands only.

## Open the homepage of the website for instructions on your assignment
